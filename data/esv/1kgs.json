      "Now King David was old and advanced in years. And although they covered him with clothes, he could not get warm.",
      "Therefore his servants said to him, \"Let a young woman be sought for my lord the king, and let her wait on the king and be in his service. Let her lie in your arms, that my lord the king may be warm.\"",
      "So they sought for a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.",
      "The young woman was very beautiful, and she was of service to the king and attended to him, but the king knew her not.",
      "Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, \"I will be king.\" And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.",
      "His father had never at any time displeased him by asking, \"Why have you done thus and so?\" He was also a very handsome man, and he was born next after Absalom.",
      "He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest. And they followed Adonijah and helped him.",
      "But Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and Nathan the prophet and Shimei and Rei and David's mighty men were not with Adonijah.",
      "Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle by the Serpent's Stone, which is beside En-rogel, and he invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the royal officials of Judah,",
      "but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty men or Solomon his brother.",
      "Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, \"Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king and David our lord does not know it?",
      "Now therefore come, let me give you advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.",
      "Go in at once to King David, and say to him, 'Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying, \"Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne\"? Why then is Adonijah king?'",
      "Then while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.\"",
      "So Bathsheba went to the king in his chamber (now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to the king).",
      "Bathsheba bowed and paid homage to the king, and the king said, \"What do you desire?\"",
      "She said to him, \"My lord, you swore to your servant by the Lord your God, saying, 'Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.'",
      "And now, behold, Adonijah is king, although you, my lord the king, do not know it.",
      "He has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army, but Solomon your servant he has not invited.",
      "And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.",
      "Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders.\"",
      "While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.",
      "And they told the king, \"Here is Nathan the prophet.\" And when he came in before the king, he bowed before the king, with his face to the ground.",
      "And Nathan said, \"My lord the king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne'?",
      "For he has gone down this day and has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!'",
      "But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he has not invited.",
      "Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not told your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?\"",
      "Then King David answered, \"Call Bathsheba to me.\" So she came into the king's presence and stood before the king.",
      "And the king swore, saying, \"As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my soul out of every adversity,",
      "as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying, 'Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,' even so will I do this day.\"",
      "Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and paid homage to the king and said, \"May my lord King David live forever!\"",
      "King David said, \"Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.\" So they came before the king.",
      "And the king said to them, \"Take with you the servants of your lord and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.",
      "And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet there anoint him king over Israel. Then blow the trumpet and say, 'Long live King Solomon!'",
      "You shall then come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, for he shall be king in my place. And I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.\"",
      "And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, \"Amen! May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, say so.",
      "As the Lord has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.\"",
      "So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David's mule and brought him to Gihon.",
      "There Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, \"Long live King Solomon!\"",
      "And all the people went up after him, playing on pipes, and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth was split by their noise.",
      "Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, \"What does this uproar in the city mean?\"",
      "While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. And Adonijah said, \"Come in, for you are a worthy man and bring good news.\"",
      "Jonathan answered Adonijah, \"No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king,",
      "and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And they had him ride on the king's mule.",
      "And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that you have heard.",
      "Solomon sits on the royal throne.",
      "Moreover, the king's servants came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours, and make his throne greater than your throne.' And the king bowed himself on the bed.",
      "And the king also said, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who has granted someone to sit on my throne this day, my own eyes seeing it.'\"",
      "Then all the guests of Adonijah trembled and rose, and each went his own way.",
      "And Adonijah feared Solomon. So he arose and went and took hold of the horns of the altar.",
      "Then it was told Solomon, \"Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon, for behold, he has laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'\"",
      "And Solomon said, \"If he will show himself a worthy man, not one of his hairs shall fall to the earth, but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.\"",

      "When David's time to die drew near, he commanded Solomon his son, saying,",

      "and keep the charge of the Lord your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn,",
      "that the Lord may establish his word that he spoke concerning me, saying, 'If your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.'",

      "Act therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.",
      "But deal loyally with the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, for with such loyalty they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother.",
      "And there is also with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord, saying, 'I will not put you to death with the sword.'",
      "Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man. You will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol.\"",
      "Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.",
      "And the time that David reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.",
      "So Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.",

      "Then he said, \"I have something to say to you.\" She said, \"Speak.\"",
      "He said, \"You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel fully expected me to reign. However, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother's, for it was his from the Lord.",
      "And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me.\" She said to him, \"Speak.\"",

      "Bathsheba said, \"Very well; I will speak for you to the king.\"",
      "So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat on his throne and had a seat brought for the king's mother, and she sat on his right.",
      "Then she said, \"I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me.\" And the king said to her, \"Make your request, my mother, for I will not refuse you.\"",
      "She said, \"Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife.\"",
      "King Solomon answered his mother, \"And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my older brother, and on his side are Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah.\"",
      "Then King Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, \"God do so to me and more also if this word does not cost Adonijah his life!",
      "Now therefore as the Lord lives, who has established me and placed me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today.\"",
      "So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he struck him down, and he died.",
      "And to Abiathar the priest the king said, \"Go to Anathoth, to your estate, for you deserve death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you carried the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and because you shared in all my father's affliction.\"",
      "So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being priest to the Lord, thus fulfilling the word of the Lord that he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.",
      "When the news came to Joab—for Joab had supported Adonijah although he had not supported Absalom—Joab fled to the tent of the Lord and caught hold of the horns of the altar.",
      "And when it was told King Solomon, \"Joab has fled to the tent of the Lord, and behold, he is beside the altar,\" Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, \"Go, strike him down.\"",
      "So Benaiah came to the tent of the Lord and said to him, \"The king commands, 'Come out.'\" But he said, \"No, I will die here.\" Then Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, \"Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.\"",
      "The king replied to him, \"Do as he has said, strike him down and bury him, and thus take away from me and from my father's house the guilt for the blood that Joab shed without cause.",
      "The Lord will bring back his bloody deeds on his own head, because, without the knowledge of my father David, he attacked and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than himself, Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.",
      "So shall their blood come back on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever. But for David and for his descendants and for his house and for his throne there shall be peace from the Lord forevermore.\"",
      "Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and put him to death. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.",
      "The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in place of Joab, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.",
      "Then the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, \"Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go out from there to any place whatever.",
      "For on the day you go out and cross the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall die. Your blood shall be on your own head.\"",

      "Its thickness was a handbreadth, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths.",

      "Moreover, each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and at the four corners were supports for a basin. The supports were cast with wreaths at the side of each.",
      "Its opening was within a crown that projected upward one cubit. Its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep. At its opening there were carvings, and its panels were square, not round.",

      "And the two worthless men came in and sat opposite him. And the worthless men brought a charge against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, \"Naboth cursed God and the king.\" So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones.",
      "Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, \"Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.\"",
      "As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, \"Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead.\"",
      "And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.",
      "Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,",
      "\"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession.",
      "And you shall say to him, 'Thus says the Lord, \"Have you killed and also taken possession?\"' And you shall say to him, 'Thus says the Lord: \"In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your own blood.\"'\"",
      "Ahab said to Elijah, \"Have you found me, O my enemy?\" He answered, \"I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the Lord.",
      "Behold, I will bring disaster upon you. I will utterly burn you up, and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.",
      "And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the anger to which you have provoked me, and because you have made Israel to sin.",
      "And of Jezebel the Lord also said, 'The dogs shall eat Jezebel within the walls of Jezreel.'",
      "Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone of his who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat.\"",
      "(There was none who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the Lord like Ahab, whom Jezebel his wife incited.",
      "He acted very abominably in going after idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the Lord cast out before the people of Israel.)",
      "And when Ahab heard those words, he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went about dejectedly.",
      "And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,",
      "\"Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the disaster in his days; but in his son's days I will bring the disaster upon his house.\""

      "For three years Syria and Israel continued without war.",
      "But in the third year Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.",
      "And the king of Israel said to his servants, \"Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we keep quiet and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?\"",
      "And he said to Jehoshaphat, \"Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?\" And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, \"I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.\"",
      "And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, \"Inquire first for the word of the Lord.\"",
      "Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, \"Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?\" And they said, \"Go up, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.\"",
      "But Jehoshaphat said, \"Is there not here another prophet of the Lord of whom we may inquire?\"",
      "And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \"There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord, Micaiah the son of Imlah, but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil.\" And Jehoshaphat said, \"Let not the king say so.\"",
      "Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, \"Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.\"",
      "Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.",
      "And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron and said, \"Thus says the Lord, 'With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.'\"",
      "And all the prophets prophesied so and said, \"Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.\"",
      "And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, \"Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.\"",
      "But Micaiah said, \"As the Lord lives, what the Lord says to me, that I will speak.\"",
      "And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, \"Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain?\" And he answered him, \"Go up and triumph; the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.\"",
      "But the king said to him, \"How many times shall I make you swear that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?\"",
      "And he said, \"I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And the Lord said, 'These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.'\"",
      "And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \"Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?\"",

      "Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord, saying, 'I will entice him.'",
      "And the Lord said to him, 'By what means?' And he said, 'I will go out, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' And he said, 'You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do so.'",
      "Now therefore behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; the Lord has declared disaster for you.\"",
      "Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, \"How did the Spirit of the Lord go from me to speak to you?\"",
      "And Micaiah said, \"Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.\"",

      "And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.",

      "And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood, and the prostitutes washed themselves in it, according to the word of the Lord that he had spoken.",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did, and the ivory house that he built and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?",

      "Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.",
      "He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.",
