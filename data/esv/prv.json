      "and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.",
      "She looks well to the ways of her household",
      "and does not eat the bread of idleness.",
      "Her children rise up and call her blessed;",
      "her husband also, and he praises her:",
      "\"Many women have done excellently,",
      "but you surpass them all.\"",
      "Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain,",
      "but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.",
      "Give her of the fruit of her hands,",
      "and let her works praise her in the gates."
